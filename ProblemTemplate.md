### Solution 1: [Approach Name]

1.  **Intuition:**
2.  **Time Complexity:**
3.  **Space Complexity:**

### Solution 2: [Approach Name, e.g., Hash Map (One-Pass)]

1.  **Intuition:**
2.  **Time Complexity:**
3.  **Space Complexity:**

```python
def function_name():
    return
```

### Solution 3: [Approach Name, e.g., Sort + Two Pointers]

1.  **Intuition:**
2.  **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
3.  **Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n) depending on sort implementation and whether the original indices must be preserved.

```python
# Add code for this solution
# Note: This approach works for finding values, but requires modification
# to return original indices.
def function_name(nums, target):
    # Implementation details here
    pass
```

### Further Analysis

- **Edge Cases:**

  1.  **Duplicates:** [How does the chosen solution handle duplicate numbers that might sum up to the target? e.g., `nums =`, `target = 6`]
  2.  **No Solution:** [What if the problem statement didn't guarantee a solution? How would the code need to change to handle this gracefully?]
  3.  **Input Size:** [Are there any constraints (e.g., very large numbers, very small array size) that would favor one solution over another?]

- **Problem Variations:**
  1.  [How would the solution change if we needed to find **all** possible pairs instead of just one?]
  2.  [What if the input was a stream of numbers instead of a static array?]
  3.  [How would the problem change if it was **Three Sum** or **K Sum**?]

### Points to Remember

1.  **Trade-offs:** [General principle learned, e.g., "Using a hash map is a classic space-for-time trade-off. It improves time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) at the cost of O(n) space."]
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** [Identify the underlying pattern, e.g., "When you need to find a pair of elements that satisfy a certain condition, a hash map is an extremely effective tool for O(1) lookups."]
3.  **Data Structure Choice:** [Why a specific data structure was chosen, e.g., "A hash map (or dictionary in Python) is ideal because it stores key-value pairs, allowing us to associate a number with its original index."]
