- **Objective:**

  1. a string of length `n` and an integer `k` are given
  2. remove exactly `k` letters (must remove)
  3. check if the remaining characters can be rearranged into a palindrome


- **Constraints:**

  1. 0 <= k <= n <= 10^5

- **Tags:** string

### Solution 1: Check for required frequencies

1.  **Intuition:**
    1. For a string to be rearranged into a palindrome:
        1. at most of 1 character can have odd frequency (if length is odd)
        2. otherwise, all characters must have even frequency
2.  **Time Complexity:** O(N)
3.  **Space Complexity:** O(26) - all lowercase alphabets

```python
from collections import Counter

def solve(s, k):
    counter = Counter(s)
    odd_count = sum([1 if v & 1 else 0 for v in counter.values()])
    return "YES" if odd_count-1 <= k else "NO"

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    print(solve(s, k))
```

### Further Analysis

- **Edge Cases:**

  1. `k = 0` -> s must already be rearrangeable into palindrome
  2. `n = k` -> remove everything. empty string = palindrome
  3. only one unqiue character -> always a palindrome regardless of k

- **Problem Variations:**

### Points to Remember

1.  In palindrome problems, thinking interms of frequencies help, whether to check for palindrome condition or to construct a palindrome itself.
