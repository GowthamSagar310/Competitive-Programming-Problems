# Maximum Area of Longest Diagonal Rectangle - Leetcode 3000

- **URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-area-of-longest-diagonal-rectangle/description/

- **Objective:**

  1. find diagonal length, area
  2. return the area of rectangle that has the longest diagonal
  3. e multiple rectangles with the longest diagonal, return the area of the rectangle having the maximum area.


- **Constraints:**

  1. 1 <= dimensions.length <= 100 -> atleast one rectangle is present
  2. dimensions[i].length == 2
  3. 1 <= dimensions[i][0], dimensions[i][1] <= 100

    2. math


### Solution 1 - Brute Force

1. Time Complexity - O(n) - loop through the dimensions once.
2. Space Complexity - O(1) - just variables

```python
def solve(dimensions):
    
    # maximum length diagonal - maxd
    # maximum area of rectangle - maxa

    maxd = maxa = 0
    for x, y in dimensions:
        # diag = sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
				diag = x ** 2 + y ** 2 # solution works even without sqrt, and also avoid floating point errors
        if diag > maxd:
            # if diag is more than the current maximum, 
            # update the max area and also maxd 
            maxa = x * y
            maxd = diag 
        elif diag == maxd:
            # if the diag is same as the current maximum,
            # we need to choose the rectange with max area.
            # (no need to update maxd)
            maxa = max(x * y, maxa)
    return maxa
```

### Further Analysis

1. How can two different rectangles have same diagonal length but different area ? 
	1. One way to think about this is to imagine is to take a diagonal of fixed length d, one end at origin, other at (x, y)
	2. If we rotate this diagonal around the origin, the endpoint moves along a circle of radius d.
	3. Every point (x,y) on that circle gives a rectangle with sides x and y,
		- The diagonal is same, as it is the radius of the circle.
		- Area changes as x and y change. 
	4. Why does the area change?
		- As diagonal roates, one side shrinks and the other grows. We stop here and think what if x grows and y shrinks, such that, the area (x.y) balances out ? 
		- We can check this by checking the rate of change of x, y and the angle of rotation changes.
		```
			x = dcosθ, y = dsinθ
			A = (d**2) * (cosθ * sinθ)
			dA / dθ ​= d**2 * cos(2θ)
			we can see that the Area  is changing with respect to the angle θ.
		```
	5. For the area to stay constant, the rate of increase of one side must perfectly cancel the rate of decrease of the other side. This is to say that dA / dθ = 0, which happens only when θ = 45 degrees. 

### Points to remember
1. there can be two different rectangles having same diagonal length but different areas.
> e.g. l = 1, b = 8 or l = 4, b = 7. both have same diagonal sqrt(65), but with different areas.
